It can be observed that the current results can be improved upon in the case for longer delays and should be focused upon to provide better results"

Public transport delays are one of the leading factors causing delays, more specifically - Bus Delays. These delays are unavoidable and can affect the efficiency of services and may enhance operational decision-making and increase commuter satisfaction. This post examines the 2024 TTC bus delay dataset to forecast delay times based on factors such as route, incident type, location, and time. We aim to classify delays into short, medium, and long categories using a logistic regression model. The final logistic regression model show moderate effectiveness in predicting delay durations. Predicted frequencies for short and medium delays correspond with actual data; however, the model under predicts long delays, highlighting the complexity of accurately capturing extended durations and their contributing factors. This study acts as a foundation for the implementation of real-time prediction models that could aid the Toronto Transit Commission in resource allocation and improving schedule adherence."

    "text": "Analysis\nBefore diving into the analysis, the data is first visually assessed, this is done by performing an exploratory data analysis by means of plots, figures and charts of the distributions of features of interest. The EDA is conducted on the dataset with the following objectives:\n\nLoading and Preprocessing Data: Handling missing values, converting timestamp data to day parts, and cleaning data fields irrelevant to our delay analysis.\nVisualization: Analyze the distribution of delays, identify top routes and locations with frequent delay incidents, and visualize delays based on day and incident type.\n\nA logistic regression model is then used to build the classification model to predict whether a delay falls into the short, medium or long duration. The C parameter in the logistic regression model is chosen using a 5-fold cross validation with the classification accuracy as the metric.\nThe reason for using logistic regression is that the coefficients of the model can be interpreted to understand the influence of different features on the probability of each delay class. This interpretability can be valuable in understanding the factors contributing to delays\nThe Python programming language (Van Rossum and Drake (2009)) and the following Python packages are used to perform tbe analysis: numpy (Harris et al. (2020)), Pandas (McKinney (2010)), altair (VanderPlas (2018)), scikit-learn (Pedregosa et al. (2011)). The code used to perform the analysis and generate the figures can be found here."

    "text": "Results and Discussion\nThe EDA of the TTC bus delay data uncovers several key insights.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Distributions of hourly incidents\n\n\n\nFigure 2 shows that majority of the delays occur during the late evenings, most likely due to the influx of people returning back home from work.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Distributions of hourly incidents\n\n\n\nFigure 3 indicates that Tuesday through Friday are the days with the highest delays, suggesting a potential correlation with weekday commuter traffic.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Types of incidents and their counts\n\n\n\nFigure 4 show that mechanical issues are the primary cause of delays, comprising a substantial portion, followed by operator-related operations and diversions. This finding indicates potential areas for intervention, such as improved maintenance or optimized scheduling, to mitigate delay incidents.\nThe EDA was very informative in understanding the features of interest for this project, which will be used to create the logistic regression model to predict the expected delay. The delay output is categorized into “Short”, “Medium” or “Long”. 5-fold cross-validation and randomized grid search were applied for C hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance. The value for C at which performance was observed to be the best, was: 0.1, and the comparison between the predictions and the actual delay classes can be observed in Figure 5\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Comparitive analysis\n\n\n\nThe results of the logistic regression model in Figure 5 show moderate effectiveness in predicting delay durations. Predicted frequencies for short and medium delays correspond with actual data; however, the model underpredicts long delays, highlighting the complexity of accurately capturing extended durations and their contributing factors. We could explore more advanced predictive models to improve accuracy. Furthermore, more data integration such as weather conditions could enhance model performance."

We aim to classify delays into short, medium, and long categories using a logistic regression model. The final logistic regression model show moderate effectiveness in predicting delay durations. Predicted frequencies for short and medium delays correspond with actual data; however, the model underpredicts long delays, highlighting the complexity of accurately capturing extended durations and their contributing factors. This study acts as a foundation for the implementation of real-time prediction models that could aid the Toronto Transit Commission in resource allocation and improving schedule adherence.\n\n## Introduction\nNo one likes being late, especially when it is due to factors out of one’s control, but would it not be nice if those factors could be mitigated. Public transport delays are one of the leading factors causing delays, more specifically - Bus Delays. In this study, it has been aimed to identify the factors which cause this delay and help identify how long this delay might be.\n## Body \n1) Importance of data:\n  * Essential for drawing inferences\n  * Statistical models can identify risk factors by analyzing historical data\n  * Predictions about future are made from data from the past\n  * Collected from Toronto Open Source data: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-bus-delay-data/\n2) Analysis process and visualizations:\n  * Delays are more frequent during peak commuting hours, particularly in the evenings and on weekdays, makes sense as\n    maximum traﬀic is present during the same times\n  * Primary contributor is mechanical issues probably due to lack of proper maintenance\n  * Operational issues are very infrequent, but present\n  * Make predictions using Statistical models such as Regression\n    – Model uses historical data from Tronto\n    – Predict type of delay (Short, Medium, or Long) at each bus stop 3) Results:\n  * Maximum delays are short and medium, and during peak commuting hours, and model is moderately accurate in predicting\n    those\n  * Maximum delays are during weekdays and due to mechanical issues 1\n  * Room for improvement in predictions on long delays, likely due to lesser data\n  \n##Conclusion\n\nIn conclusion, this report has provided an analysis which illustrates the primary factors contributing to delays and to accurately forecast the duration of these delays by utilizing route, incident types, location, and time-related features. It can be observed that the current results can be improved upon in the case for longer delays and should be focused upon to provide better results\n\n## Data\n\nThe data for this analysis was sourced from the [open.toronto.ca](http://open.toronto.ca) website, with a specific emphasis on the bus delay data for the year 2024. Raw data can be found [here](https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/ttc-bus-delay-data/).\n\n::: {#tbl-ttc_head .cell tbl-cap='Snippet of TTC bus delay data' execution_count=1}\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-display execution_count=1}\n```{=html}\n<div>\n<style scoped>\n    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n        vertical-align: middle;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n        vertical-align: top;\n    }\n\n    .dataframe thead th {\n        text-align: right;\n    }\n</style>\n<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n  <thead>\n    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n      <th></th>\n      <th>Date</th>\n      <th>Route</th>\n      <th>Time</th>\n      <th>Day</th>\n      <th>Location</th>\n      <th>Incident</th>\n      <th>Min Delay</th>\n      <th>Min Gap</th>\n      <th>Direction</th>\n      <th>Vehicle</th>\n    </tr>\n  </thead>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <th>0</th>\n      <td>2024-01-01</td>\n      <td>89</td>\n      <td>02:08</td>\n      <td>Monday</td>\n      <td>KEELE AND GLENLAKE</td>\n      <td>Vision</td>\n      <td>10</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>N</td>\n      <td>7107</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>1</th>\n      <td>2024-01-01</td>\n      <td>39</td>\n      <td>02:30</td>\n      <td>Monday</td>\n      <td>FINCH STATION</td>\n      <td>General Delay</td>\n      <td>20</td>\n      <td>40</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>8914</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>2</th>\n      <td>2024-01-01</td>\n      <td>300</td>\n      <td>03:13</td>\n      <td>Monday</td>\n      <td>BLOOR AND MANNING</td>\n      <td>General Delay</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>8562</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>3</th>\n      <td>2024-01-01</td>\n      <td>65</td>\n      <td>03:23</td>\n      <td>Monday</td>\n      <td>PARLIAMENT AND BLOOR</td>\n      <td>Security</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>N</td>\n      <td>8574</td>\n    </tr>\n    <tr>\n      <th>4</th>\n      <td>2024-01-01</td>\n      <td>113</td>\n      <td>03:37</td>\n      <td>Monday</td>\n      <td>MAIN STATION</td>\n      <td>Security</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>0</td>\n      <td>NaN</td>\n      <td>8541</td>\n    </tr>\n  </tbody>\n</table>\n</div>\n```\n:::\n:::\n\n\nThe dataset contains in total 45300 rows and 10 columns. Each row in the dataset represents one instance of delay, specifying its route, date and time, location, classification of bus incident, and its delay duration. A snippet of the dataset is show in @tbl-ttc_head.\n\n## Analysis\n\nAn EDA analysis is first conducted on the dataset with the folliowing objectives:\n\n1.  **Loading and Preprocessing Data:** Handling missing values, converting timestamp data to day parts, and cleaning data fields irrelevant to our delay analysis.\n2.  **Visualization:** Analyze the distribution of delays, identify top routes and locations with frequent delay incidents, and visualize delays based on day and incident type.\n\nA linear regression model is then used to build the classification model to predict whether a delay falls into the short, medium or long duration. The C parameter in the linear regression model is chosen using a 5-fold cross validation with the classification accuracy as the metric.\n\nThe Python programming language (@Python) and the following Python packages are used to perform tbe analysis: numpy (@numpy), Pandas (@pandas), altair (@altair), scikit-learn (@scikit-learn). The code used to perform the analysis and generate the figures can be found [here](https://github.com/UBC-MDS/group04/tree/main/scripts).\n\n## Results and Discussion\n\nThe EDA analysis of the TTC bus delay data uncovers several key insights.\n\n![](../../results/images/incidents_by_hour.png){#fig-incidents_by_hour width=\"70%\"}\n\n@fig-incidents_by_hour shows that majority of the delays occur during the late evenings, most likely due to the influx of people returning back home from work.\n\n![](../../results/images/incidents_by_day.png){#fig-incidents_by_day width=\"70%\"}\n\n@fig-incidents_by_day indicates that Tuesday through Friday are the days with the highest delays, suggesting a potential correlation with weekday commuter traffic.\n\n![](../../results/images/incident_types.png){#fig-incident_types width=\"70%\"}\n\n@fig-incident_types show that mechanical issues are the primary cause of delays, comprising a substantial portion, followed by operator-related operations and diversions. This finding indicates potential areas for intervention, such as improved maintenance or optimized scheduling, to mitigate delay incidents.\n\nThe EDA analysis was very informative in understanding the columns of interest for this project, which will be used to create the logistic regression model to predict the expected delay. The delay output will be categorized into \"Short\", \"Medium\" or \"Long\". 5-fold cross-validation and randomized grid search were applied for C hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.\n\n![](../../results/images/PredictedVsActual.png){#fig-predicted_vs_actual width=\"70%\"}\n\nThe results of the logistic regression model in @fig-predicted_vs_actual show moderate effectiveness in predicting delay durations. Predicted frequencies for short and medium delays correspond with actual data; however, the model underpredicts long delays, highlighting the complexity of accurately capturing extended durations and their contributing factors. We could explore more advanced predictive models to improve accuracy. Furthermore, more data integration such as weather conditions could enhance model performance.\n\n",
